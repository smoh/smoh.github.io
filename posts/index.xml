      <description>I was inspired by a recent paper by Boubert &amp;amp; Everall 2020 to consider the inference of the probability of a biased coin.
The problem is the following: given a table of $N$ coin flip experiments where you have, for each experiment, the number of times it was flipped and the number of times it showed heads, we want to infer the probability that this coin shows head.

      <description>The Table Access Protocol (TAP) is a way to access astronomical databases using the Astronomical Data Query Language (ADQL). The ADQL is a variant of SQL that supports querying grammar for astronomical operations.
Simbad is a database for astronomical objects that is updated constantly from the literature. It can be accessed by various methods including TAP.
I recently wanted to
 retrieve all related bibliography for a set of objects get all radial velocity measurements for a set of objects  It turns out this is fairly simple with pyvo and ADQL.</description>
